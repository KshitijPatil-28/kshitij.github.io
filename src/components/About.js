    <h2>Student and FrontEnd Developer</h2>
    <p>Talking about all the things in my life, I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful solutions. I always strive to write elegant and efficient code whether it be HTML, CSS or Javascript. </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>When I'm not infront of any screen, you'll find me in the "home gym" or on the court smashing some shuttles.</p>
